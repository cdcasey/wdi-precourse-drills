        <h1>Future Me</h1>
        <p>I'm hoping my experience at Galvanize will help jump-start a career change focusing on web development. I'm not only hoping to learn a lot about the coding aspects, but about methods to approaching projects as well as new ways of working with other people. I am planning on seeking a job in a few years, but I hope to freelance one day.</p>
